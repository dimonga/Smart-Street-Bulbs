# Smart Streetlights

Image if the streetlights around us are smart enough to sense,monitor and analyse the surroundings.The initial plan of the smart street bulbs is to develop a prototype which is cabable of sensing rainfall, temperature, pollution, pathogens, po holes, traffic intensity  in the locality of a street bulb.Along with all these features I am trying to incorporate my latest research i.e. Light fidelity inside the bulb.Which is basically the transfer of data using these streetlights itself.

## Description
### The following are the features of proposed Smart Lightning system </br>
1.	The street lamps will have a feature of Visible light communication, i.e. the street lamp itself will be a source of data, while users can simply hover their devices under light for the reception of data.</br>
2.	The street will be having a line of streetlights that are communicating with each other using Wifi/bluetooth/zigbee and sending the data of every locality to their related authority.</br>
3.	These devices being Internet of Things enabled can be </br>
4.	There are some sensors inside the light bulb, so the need for having individual sensor station is eliminated.</br>
#### The bulb comprises of following sensors:</br>
-	Bacteria and Harmful virus detectors : Measuring the amount the various pathogens present in a locality and showing data of respective area</br>
-	Motion detection : Detects the intensity of traffics and turns ON/OFF or dims the street light in order to save energy</br>
-	Smoke and Pollution detectors : keeps a log of the pollution and sends the data to Pollution control department</br>
-	Temperature and Rainfall sensors : to detect the temperature and rainfall of a particular area in order to get info about a particular region</br>
-	Pot-hole detection: detects the pothole present near the bulb so that the drive can get information about the uneven roads thus can reduce the number of accidents.</br>
