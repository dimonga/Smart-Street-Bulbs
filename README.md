# [Smart Streetligh

Image if the streetlights around us are smart enough to sense,monitor and analyse the surroundings.The initial plan of the smart street bulbs is to develop a prototype which is cabable of sensing rainfall, temperature, pollution, pathogens, po holes, traffic intensity  in the locality of a street bulb.Along with all these features I am trying to incorporate my latest research i.e. Light fidelity inside the bulb.Which is basically the transfer of data using these streetlights itself.
